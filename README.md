# Introduction

This is a python wrapper module aiming to expose ISAPI from a Hikvision IP camera or NVR to third party applications. The motivation of this project started when we have multiple applications need to communicate with Hikvision devices, and we find it difficult to deal with the XML data returned in PHP, especially listening to the event stream.
